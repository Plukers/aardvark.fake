# Aardvark.Fake

This repository contains some useful extensions for the [Fake][1]/[Paket][2] infrastructure, 
which we use in our projects, such as [Aardvark.Rendering][3] and [Aardvark.Base][4].
Most importantly, AdditionalSources.fsx provides functionality ``cabal add-source`` like functionality for referencing source versions of dependent packages.
